<!-- Ideally I would like the fieldsets to all have their top border aligned, but I cannot get that to work right now. 
Obviously, the search bar takes you nowhere/doesn't have search suggestions, and the settings field (named stuff for now) also takes
you nowhere. The Feed field will also expand once there are actual posts. 

I am unsure of the best way to implement the CSS for now, so I just put it in a style section in the header. When the javascript is 
added, it will probably make more sense for that to be its own file, as it will most likely interact with multiple pages. The code is 
pretty straightforward so I didn't see the need to comment, but if anyone has any questions or wants to add/edit something let me know.
