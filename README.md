Short overview of our site: 
	Our goal with ProLink is to revolutionize the employment landscape by merging the best features of Reddit, LinkedIn, and Pinterest into a dynamic web service. ProLink is intended to act as a versatile employment forum, allowing users to seamlessly share their resumes, connect with potential employers, and explore diverse career opportunities. Using the collaborative and interactive nature of Reddit, users can participate in discussions, ask for advice, and share insights pertaining to specialized communities (e.g., recent news updates). Incorporating LinkedIn’s professional networking capabilities will encourage users to establish meaningful connections, highlight their expertise, and discover job openings tailored to their skills and interests. The usage of Pinterest’s visual appeal and organization will help users create personalized feeds based on personal interest hashtags, allowing for efficient discovery of relevant content. Ultimately, we want to create a productive and safe environment where users can thrive, upload projects, collaborate, communicate, and progress their professional journeys.

Use Cases:
	Our main target audience is professionals with skills that can be categorized and grouped with others who share the same skills. People who want to get their name and work to be shown to potential employers or simply just see interesting work and communicate about projects. When the users first visit our website, they will be prompted to log in or sign up with their email. If they log in, it will take them to our home page. If they choose to sign up, they will be prompted for user information to help them set up their accounts and find similar interest hashtags. Once the account is complete, they will also be redirected to the homepage. The home page will show some of the most popular projects and posts in the user's selected interests, where the user will be able to scroll to view other posts, comment, like, and view the original poster’s profile. There will also be buttons for the user to search, where they can find other users by name, interests, or other criteria. The user will also have a settings option where they can change their profile to make it more professional, such as an option to upload a resume, cover letter, profile picture, bio, etc. Lastly, and most importantly, the user will be able to click on a post button where they can upload their own creation and content to share with other users.
